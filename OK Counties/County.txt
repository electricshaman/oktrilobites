  Description
    Abstract:
      This is an ArcView shapefile of State-wide county boundaries
      for Oklahoma State. 
    Purpose:
     This county boundary data set was prepared by the Center for Spatial Analysis 
     at the University of Oklahoma to provide information about the county 
     boundaries within Oklahoma State as provided by 2000 TIGER/Line files 
     of the Census Bureau. The TIGER/Line data for the individual counties 
     was transformed into an ArcView shape file for the entire Oklahoma State.

  Attribute_Accuracy
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attribute information contains County name, State fips code,   
      and County fips code.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
      The county boundaries were originally derived from TIGER/Line 
      2000 files of the Bureau of the Census. TIGER/Line files were originally
      digitized at a scale of 1:100,000 to an accuracy of 160 ft. 
  Completeness_Report:
    The compiler embodies the syntax of the 1998 version of the Content Standard 
    for Digital Geospatial Metadata, known as FGDC-STD-001-1998 and also supports 
    the Biological Data Profile of that standard, FGDC-STD-001.1-1999. Local extensions 
    to the standard are permitted and a mechanism is provided 
    that allows these extensions to be described to the compiler.
